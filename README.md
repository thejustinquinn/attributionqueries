# attributionqueries
CoolTShirts sells shirts of all kinds, as long as they are T-shaped and cool. Recently, CTS started a few marketing campaigns to increase website visits and purchases. Using touch attribution, they’d like to map their customers’ journey: from initial visit to purchase. They can use that information to optimize their marketing campaigns. This project will guide you through some of that process.  At this point you should have taken the lesson on touch attribution. This project will guide you through a number of queries on CoolTShirts’ user data (see the schema here).  Check off the steps as you go. In the rare chance that your project gets stuck in a bad state — maybe you accidentally edited the data —, refresh the page.
